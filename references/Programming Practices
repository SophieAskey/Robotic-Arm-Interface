In order to maintain a neat and organized code base we will follow a few simple programming practices and naming conventions.

Programming Practices
- Header files containing a class will be named ClassName.h
- Pass sets of values (sensor values) to methods as an array. Easier to iterate through. 
- To return an array you must pass in an instantiated array as a reference parameter to the method. 
  - There are two kinds of parameters, pass by value (using a copy, not modifying parameter) and pass by reference (get the 
    actual variable you are passing, can modify). 

Naming Conventions 
- Variables names will be lowercase and contain "_" to seperate words. Ex: my_var_name 
- Function and Method names will use camelCase conventions.            Ex: myCalcFunc()
- Class names will capitalize the first letter of each word.           Ex: MyClassName

Example:
// This example is written as a C++ header file (.h file) with the intention of importing into an Arduino program.
//
// File named: ClassNameExample.h

class ClassNameExample{

  public: // Can be accessed/called from outside of class
    // Class public members
    int int_data_member; // This can be a value that does not change but can be accessed outside of class. 
                         // Adding the static const datatype allows for this data member to be accessed 
                         // WITHOUT instanting an object. The const prevents this members value from being
                         // changed. Not sure if we will use static const, but I wanted to introduce it.

    // Class member setter and getter prototypes. Setters and getters are used to access and modify datamembers.
    // These data members can private, protected (most likely will not use but you can look into) and public. Setters
    // and getters for public datamembers is fairly redundant as these members can be directly modified and accessed. 
    // However, setters and getters can allow access and modification to specific private data members, not all private
    // members will need setters and or getters. 
    void set_priv_int(int); // Write access
    int  get_priv_int();    // Read access
    bool get_priv_bool();   // Read access 
    
    // Public class method protoypes.
    void classMethod1(); // Takes no arguments and returns nothing
  
  private: // Can only be accessed within this class
    // Class private members
    int  priv_int;  // Read and write outside of class throught setter and getter
    bool priv_bool; // Read only outside of class through getter
    
    // Private class method prototype
    int  classMethod2(int, String); // Takes an int and String as arguments and returns and int

}; // This is the end of the class declaration. We still need to define the class method prototypes we declared. 

// To define a class method prototype outside of the class declaration you need to prepend the class method name 
// with ClassName:: (in our case ClassNameExample::). This allows the compiler (the thing that checks if your 
// program is valid) to match the method definition to the method protoype.

// Setter for priv_int
void ClassNameExample::set_priv_int(int value){ priv_int = value; }
// Getter for priv_int
int  ClassNameExample::get_priv_int(){ return priv_int; }
// Getter for priv_bool
bool ClassNameExample::get_priv_bool(){ return priv_bool; }

// Public, can be accessed outside of class.
void ClassNameExample::classMethod1(){
  // Method body
}

// Private, will be used within the class. Takes in two arguments and returns an int, could a calculation method of sorts. 
int ClassNameExample::classMethod2(int i, String str){
  // Method body
}
